 * SSJ has been inspired by the SSI (http://openssi.net) framework. SSJ is not a
 * one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nor does SSJ pretend
 * to offer SSI's comprehensive functionality and performance (this is java after all).
 * Nevertheless, SSJ borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI.
